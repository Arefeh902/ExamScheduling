## Introduction

The problem of some universities in exam scheduling is they can not find a good (or probably best) schedule solution for exams. It is so important for both students and teachers to be satisfied with the schedule. In this project, with the help of `Genetic Algorithm`, we are going to find a good solution to fit courses in the best way.

## Installation

Python is used for the algorithm, so you must have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed in your system.

Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For dataset, put the BLOB.txt and BLOB2.txt near the program.

Then run:

```
python main.py
```

Execution takes some time, so just wait for the results.
